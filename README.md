# Medical-Image-Captioning

Medical image captioning is the task of automatically generating sentences that describe input medical images in the best way possible in the form of natural language. It requires an effective way to deal with understanding and evaluating the similarity among visual and text-based components and generating a sequence of output words. Automatic medical image caption generation has been an appealing research problem for computer-aided diagnosis to lighten the responsibility of doctors in recent years. The deep learning methodology for natural image captioning is effectively adapted to generating the respective captions. However, medical image captioning is different from the natural image captioning task as clinical and diagnostic keywords referenced are significant in medical image captioning in contrast with the equal importance of every word in a natural image caption. 
Hence, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph and transformer decoder based image captioning technique which predicts links between images and words to obtain the keywords for each image. The combined image and word embeddings are then used to generate coherent medical captions.
